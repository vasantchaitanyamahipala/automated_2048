**Running the Game**
To play the game, simply execute the following command:

python game_2048.py


After running the game, you will be presented with 8 options. You can choose one option to proceed with.

**Benchmarking the Algorithm
**
If you want to analyze and benchmark the A* algorithm's performance, you can use the benchmark.py script. This script allows you to test the algorithm's execution time by running it multiple times.

How to Benchmark
Run the following command:

1. python benchmark.py

2. A popup will appear asking you to specify how many times you want the algorithm to run.

3. Enter the number of runs you'd like to perform.

4. The script will provide an estimate of the execution time based on the number of runs.


**Project Structure**
game_2048.py: The main script that runs the 2048 game with the A* algorithm.
benchmark.py: A script for benchmarking the performance of the algorithm by running multiple iterations and estimating the time.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Required libraries (pygame)
